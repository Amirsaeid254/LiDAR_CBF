## High-Order Time-Varying Barrier Functions for Safety in Unmapped and Dynamic Environments

![contour_plot_animation (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccf6fb10-cd6b-4b6f-8846-0bb3963a22c6)

This repository provides implementations of **High-Order Time-Varying Barrier Functions** for safety in unmapped and dynamic environments. The package depends on [HOCBF Composition](https://github.com/pedramrabiee/hocbf_composition) to create barrier objects and synthesize safe control inputs. It includes classes for LiDAR sensors, synthesizing barrier functions from sensor data, and the time-varying smooth composition of barriers.
